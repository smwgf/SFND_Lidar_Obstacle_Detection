Proximity(point,cluster):
    mark point as processed
    add point to cluster
    nearby points = tree(point)
    Iterate through each nearby point
        If point has not been processed
            Proximity(cluster)

EuclideanCluster():
    list of clusters 
    Iterate through each point
        If point has not been processed
            Create cluster
            Proximity(point, cluster)
            cluster add clusters
    return clusters
